take into account enemy fleets in transit to nearby planets

Let enemy wear down neutral: If an enemy is sending to a neutral, don't send until our fleets would arrive on turn after they arrive.

scoring: add slight bonus if near high producing planets

take into account turns remaining (max 200) when calculating eventualities


___________
Algorithm

For each planet:
	Send all of our ships and enemy ships to it, and evaluate the game state until x turns, where x is the largest of (distance to any planet + turns remaining for fleets to that planet)
	Should be stable ownership by then, apart from differences in overall production wearing down one side.

Evaluate which are the worthwhile planets to take.
